# Lessons Learned

## Challenges Faced
1. **Inconsistent Commit Messages:** Many commits had vague or inconsistent messages, making it difficult to understand the purpose of changes.
2. **Divergent Branches:** Multiple branches caused confusion about which one was the official version, resulting in conflicts during merges.
3. **Lost Context:** Lack of detailed comments in pull requests or issues led to misunderstanding the context of certain decisions.

## Strategies for Maintaining Clean History
1. **Structured Commit Messages:** Adopt a standardized format for commit messages to improve clarity.
2. **Rebase Instead of Merge:** Use rebase strategies to keep the commit history linear and easier to read.
3. **Regular Cleanups:** Schedule periodic reviews of the branch history to prune irrelevant branches and clean up commit history where necessary.

## Team Coordination Approaches
1. **Daily Stand-ups:** Conduct brief daily meetings to discuss progress, roadblocks, and plans for the day to synchronize the team's efforts.
2. **Code Reviews:** Implement a code review process for all new changes to ensure consistent quality and documentation.
3. **Use of Project Management Tools:** Leverage tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) for tracking issues and tasks to keep everyone aligned on project progress.
